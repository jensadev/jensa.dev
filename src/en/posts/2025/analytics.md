This is a change starting today; I'm trying out [counter.dev](https://counter.dev) to collect some user data for this site.

Counter.dev collects anonymized user data that I can use to see the number of visitors, among other things, and it's mostly for my own curiosity. Other than that, this site only saves your chosen theme and whether you allow it to save the theme (it's stored in localStorage).

Previously, I used Google Analytics, but I want a solution that is hosted in Europe.
