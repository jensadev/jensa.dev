  I am a teacher who enjoys web development, design, and coding.
  Combining these interests in my work is a privilege.
  On this website, I collect <a href="/en/archive">notes</a>, <a href="/en/projects">projects</a>, and <a href="/en/resources">resources</a>.
  On <a href="https://github.com/jensadev">GitHub</a>, you can find things I have coded.
